# Hashtags

A **hashtag** is the `#` character, followed by a string of letters and/or
numbers.  They can be used for grouping resources into districts or other
categories.

[DMS] resource uses:

- [Message patterns] can have a **compose** hashtag
- [Message lines] can have a **restrict** hashtag
- [DMS actions] use hashtags to select affected signs
- [Alert configurations] and [alert messages]
- [Lane-use MULTI] indications
- [Permissions] can restrict access by hashtag
